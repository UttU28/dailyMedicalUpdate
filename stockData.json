It is earning season and a bounce higher could happen as a result, but there just isn't anything supporting any extended upside movement from the 8-Day, weekly, and 3-Day charts at this point.

We have to realize the rising 21MA would impact the candle and not so much the candle impacting the 21MA, as the 21MA is basically created by the movement of 21 (8-day-periods) as opposed to a single 8-Day candle (so pressure pushing upward).

In my opinion, though a down has barely started on this timeframe, the conditions of this chart are increasing the potential for a bounce (upward movement) for smaller charts. The larger charts are not providing the permissions for upward movement though a bounce during earnings season and here in the Super-6 makes sense. Any bounce becomes about testing potential resistance levels on this chart (the 21MA as example) or on the smaller charts\u2026 and likely going sideways or resetting for additional downward movement from there in my opinion."

The 21MA is declining with the candles already well below. So, until the 21 starts to flatten again, the pressure is to the downside. Currently everything on this chart and the permissions from the monthly and quarterly suggest a continued decline but at some point, a bounce upward to at least test potential resistance on this chart time-frame is coming. With the potential support below and the position of the SRSI and red DM line, after some sideways to lower, I wouldn't be surprised to see a bounce on this chart time-frame. Bounce not a directional change. This is an 8-Day chart and it doesn't change directions quickly (the 21MA is just starting to decline). Perhaps the bounce is the result of earning season (though this symbols has already reported it can be effected by other company's earnings)."

The SRSI lines are both below the 20-level with the red moving slightly higher trying to cross above the green line currently at 2.57. The green line is flat to slightly higher currently at 1.76. The MACD lines are declining. The red line is below the green and moving higher toward the green line. The red DM line is moving lower and cocked at 5.32. The declining 21MA is well above the current price. With normal daily movements for this symbol, it will likely take more than a few of these 3-Day candles to get to a test of the 21MA as potential resistance. Currently, the larger charts are indicating the decline may continue but they are showing signs that a bounce to test potential resistance levels may take place in the coming few weeks. I wouldn't be surprised to see some sideways to higher movement, now as the candle is below the 233MA, so, perhaps up to the 233MA as a white candle or doji. It is Earnings Season, given that, and the potential support below, bouncing around on the support levels from the monthly to this 3-Day chart or up slightly to test potential resistance levels and allow smaller charts to rest and recover seems more likely than a big push higher in my opinion. Now understand, with a daily movement (low to high of $9-12, a bounce of a few days could be up $30 but it's not about the numbers higher, chart reading is about seeing the potential testing of resistance areas and not losing your objectivity)."

The down auto-wave is formed and has NOW shifted to the right attached to the currently forming candle. The rising144 and 55MAs are laminated closely below as potential support. With the position of the current candle, a magnetic battle between the 89MA and the 144MA may begin if this goes a bit lower. The TBB is starting to move higher while the BBB is moving lower. The 89MA is still considered support as this candle isn't \u201cfar enough\u201d below it to make the 89MA potential resistance (magnetic pull). The 144MA and 55MA are laminated and sitting as potential support (again, against additional decline) of course with the declining BBB. The SRSI lines are both below the 20-level and declining with the red below my low yellow line sitting currently at 0.64 and the green line currently sitting at 7.30. The MACD lines are declining with the red line below the green line but now starting to decrease the distance between the two lines. The red DM line is cocked at 7.98. The 21MA is declining with the candles already well below. So, until the 21 starts to flatten again, the pressure is to the downside. Currently everything on this chart and the permissions from the monthly and quarterly suggest a continued decline but at some point, a bounce upward to at least test potential resistance on this chart timeframe is coming. With the potential support below and the position of the SRSI and red DM line, after some sideways to lower, I wouldn't be surprised to see a bounce on this chart timeframe. Bounce not a directional change. This is an 8-Day chart and it doesn't change directions quickly (the 21MA is just starting to decline). Perhaps the bounce is the result of earning season (though this symbols has already reported it can be effected by other company's earnings)."

On this time-frame the candle forming the bearish flag is not completed yet. Typically the candles continue to rise or go sideways until the green SRSI line reaches the 80-level once the red line has reached that level (a geeky scientist says 97% of the time, let's just still the bald guy at 95% of the time). So, really ready for a decline on this time frame. Not yet but it is coming. Coming when? Well, it is a monthly chart and you are all intelligent people when you remove your ego, greed, and fear. So finishing the month where it is or a little higher / lower, maybe March is a smaller candle (red or white). April through mid-May slightly higher from March and then the summer movement zone. Lower then (maybe a lot lower just makes sense from here).

A cross lower is often an important piece to the puzzle but not always (the cross of 6/18/23 as an example). However, a 2nd cross lower while above the 80-level is a bit significant (not there yet, but probably coming). They don't happen as often but when they do you'll want to give that a little more weight in the current puzzle whenever present. The green DM line is cocked to decline at 5.18 (didn't change from yesterday with today's upward movement, it's a weekly chart, not a daily chart). The MAs are pressing higher with the 21MA rising from the rising 34MA, and the 55MA has eased above the 144MA. The 21MA is rising with no signs of starting to flatten at this point (but it is just Wednesday). Today is just a red bodied sort of a doji but the candle is not complete so in isolation, today it means nothing. At some point there will be an attack (a decline) on the rising 21MA to begin the flattening that may not last but may be tradeable to the downside. This is a weekly chart, that attack could last a number of weeks and then see the candles rise back up as the 21MA typically has to flatten before any movement the other direction lasts. Historically over the last 3-years movements higher of 5-weeks or more almost always were followed by 3-weeks or more decline once the decline started. Once again it's something to be aware of (the candle count matters). This market will need to decline substantially to get to a test of the 21MA as potential support. It can do that in a week but more likely more than just one would take place to get there. There is a decline setting up of some significance sometime in the WEEKS to MONTHS ahead, the 2nd cross of the SRSI above the 80-level suggests a decline may be starting but it is not there yet but the candle isn't closed.

How the day ends of Friday is often how Monday begins. On a week where the market has risen basically throughout, a professional on Wall Street will tend to lighten up there positions on Friday afternoon to \u201cbank some profits\u201d.

The rise overall has been fairly steep and with the candles rising outside the Bollinger Bands, I wouldn't be surprised to see a reduction of movement to more normal sized candles in the coming months as the candles work back inside the BBs. Whether that means a sideways movement or a decline remains to be seen. Currently the 21, 34, 55, and 89MAs are all pushing higher. The is no flattening in sight on the 21MA. With the rising 21MA nearly 209 points away from the current price, a decline just to begin the flattening process could take at least a few months and some significant down movement that may be tradeable during that process. Remember, any down movement for the rest of this month will not change the direction of this chart and will all be contained inside this single monthly candle forming (not quite even 1/2-way completed). A 2-week decline at this point would only determine the size of the wick at the top and size of the candle body, has not change the direction of the chart."

The Christmas Cross, SRSI, and MACD are all indicating higher, and the green DM line is moving lower with a trajectory heading lower as well and ain a cocked to decline position. We have now put in a new high compared to the high on 1/25/24, so, the potential of the formation of a bearish divergence on the SRSI is growing. The SRSI lines are well below the previous peak but the red line would need to turn lower and I'd prefer some more upward movement of the candles and the SRSI before that happens to be more confident in the pattern. The MACD is expanding the distance between the red and green lines higher. The green DM line is not cocked but has a downward trajectory which generally means a rising move but can get cocked with a flat movement too. The 21MA doesn't show any signs of beginning to flatten yet. The rising 21MA is well below the current price. It still would likely take at least a few of these candles (if not more) to reach the rising 21MA to begin the flattening process. The red SRSi line is hitting mt downward expanding top channel line.As we near the end of the earnings season push higher, this chart being up against the TBB and DM green line now cocked for a decline, suggests a decline is probably going to start in the near future (next few candles possibly). Again, 3-day to make a candle so potentially in the next 9-days isn't any kind of bold predictions. Doing the market well isn't about bold predictions\u2026 it is about being aware of the possibilities and taking action on the obvious. Though conditions on the bigger charts are setting up for a decline in the future there are no obvious permissions for a decline yet. So each stock can move a little bit up or down within the extent of the bigger charts permissions. I wouldn't be surprised by a red candle on this chart next. The very recent history (September 2023 to now make that thought seem sensable. That covers the fall winter movement zone into the early part of the transitional zone now."

A down on the daily chart to test the rising 21MA and begin the flattening process would be around 41 points. Though this symbol could do that in a day, that would be unusual.

Tomorrow will be more revealing as another day will typically shake the cobwebs of confusion away at times like this."

The half-way point of the 2nd 233-candle of 1/25/2024 could be a resistance area to watch to stall any bounce. The flattening 21MA following a rise is a significant thing most of the time. Given the gap down of the daily (mid-point level of the 1/25/24 2nd 233-candle, the pressure to decline in the coming weeks is starting to build though not ready to do so to any significant degree yet.

With the Bollinger Bands starting to squeeze, the volatility of this position would typically reduce so some potential of sideways within the Bollinger Band constraints for a bit, before an explosion. Sideways at this point would be a slight pull-back to test potential support of the 21MA or moving sideways above it.

The SRSI turned lower from the 100-level and actually crossed with both lines still above the 80-level. The red MACD line went sideways today while the green line continued to rise resulting in the lines getting closer to each other but not close to crossing yet. The red DM line declined today but there was only a slight rise in the cocked green DM line (a lot less movement to the green than was seen in the red). The green is still cocked and rose to the 4.18 level but hasn't fired yet. As I wrote Friday, a test of the rising 21MA in the near future is certainly going to happen. Currently there is some permission form the 233 chart for that movement but not the weekly, 3-day, or daily charts. Sideways to lower to test the rising 21MA, rest, and reset for another rise to allow the weekly, 3-day, and daily to be in a better position to provide permissions for a decline seems likely. Again, this is only Monday. So a few days of movement this week may allow a better perspective and permissions from the bigger charts for the decline that they are setting up. Too many students develop a bias that favors one indicator instead of learning to assess all for indicators. This applies to the MAs, the Bollinger Bands, on the current chart as well as everything on the next two bigger charts are saying as to the permissions to move. The \u201ctrick\u201c is to not be biased, though.

A down is still coming on this symbol. A pop up here during the Super-6 might happen but the bigger charts are really tired of the rise at this point."

I could see a pullback from these levels slightly a push higher still as the 233 indicators are not in a position to decline (yet) and a test of those daily gap-down lines a serious possibility. Though the indicators are still signally a rise the declining TBB is potentially going to hold that up some (perhaps a pause, before rising) then probably on test the mid-point of the 1/25/2024 233-candle as potential resistance and the daily gap-down kicking in\u2026 then gap down to go down\u2026 just at the right time of the year for that to take place."

The Bollinger Bands are fairly uniform and tubular. With the DM lines in the noise, I wouldn't be surprised to see sideways to lower toward the BBB and just somewhat stuck to the 55MA (I'll be covering that in ES-2 Saturday as well)."

With the candles near the TBB, the SRSI in the middle, the MACD stuck in \u201csideways\u201d, and the DM lines still in the noise, I wouldn't be surprised to see a slight lift or sideways movement as the 233 and daily charts are in conflict. Now understand, the TBB of the 233 chart is about 25 points higher from here. The BBB of the 233-chart is 26 points from here. Both seems like a lot but for a stock that moves that is $609 it really isn't that much!"

However, the last candle of the day pulled back and was not able to carry the strength through to the close. The 233-charts declining TBB smacked it pretty well. The red SRSI line is above 80 and the green is pretty close to 80, The green DM line is cocked to rise and it shows signs of trying to do so. I wouldn't be surprised to see a pull-back tomorrow at least by the end of the day, if not just flat to slightly lower throughout the day based on the sideways permission from the daily and the 233's TBB and Bollinger Band squeeze. Again, markets and stocks typically do something interesting about once a month. This stock has been a yawn all month at this point. Maybe something interesting happens mid-month maybe not."

It doesn't mean trying to guess when the reversal of direction is going to happen to be \u201cfirst in\u201d. We miss the first, collect the big fat chuck in the middle, and maybe a smaller chunk at the end or just let that alone too. Over and over and over again! We forward chart read to see opportunities for potential entry developing and once entered. Then we are looking to see the exit approaching. We are always looking to exit, never hoping to stay in!We have to assess and put the puzzle together objectively each day, on each candle close, and not get caught up in what has been or what we hope will be.*The puzzle pieces that we have to consider right now include it's the summertime movement zone, only 5-trading days leftfor the quarter (window dressing) as well as the month (warning season), June (MTM calendar) and the 2nd month of the Summer Movement Zone is almost complete. Super-6 is coming and the Earnings window for the earliest reporting symbols is open.Of course this is just Chart Watch. We have to be aware of the YTEI, the MTM, the MZ, the time of the month, and the historical movements of the stock or market\u2026 it's not \u201cjust a chart thing\u201d, we have to fold all the puzzle pieces together. You have to think and solve this particular puzzle. Each day, each candle close, even on the same symbol is a new puzzle that has to be objectively solved.

There is a potential bullish divergence on the SRSI that you must be aware of. To me, this looks like sideways to slightly higher to test potential resistance before likely continuing lower on this chart, in my opinion. The biggest charts are more sideways than up or down, this 233 chart bounced to test potential resistance areas and may rise a bit more before some sideways and then lower takes place. The permissions of the bigger charts are sideways so the smaller charts can move up and down a little as needed. Without a clear direction either way, but this time frame seems to be positioning to move a bit higher to sideways than anything else at this point to test potential resistance, in my opinion."

There are no permissions in place from the larger charts for any extended down at this point but I wouldn't be surprised to see some down movement to test potential support the early part of next week."

This is about entering when evidence is in place (so the move has just begun, but just started WITH permissions from the next bigger charts) and then exiting when the movement appears to be over (often missing the last bit of movement)!

Today made 9 of 10 candles in a row white with the one that wasn't being a doji. Going back a year, this was the 1st time that happened.

                    "13": "Today is day 2 of 8 for this candle. The candle opened just below one of my purple lines and moved lower and higher, currently as a doji candle (candle not closed). The candles have been basically moving sideways since the second half of February. The TBB is possibly starting to flatten. The up auto-wave has formed but has not shifted to the right at this point. The 21MA is rising. The 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, and 610MAs are all rising below (applying pressure higher) as potential support. The BBB is also rising as potential support. The Christmas Cross lines are basically sideways with the red above declining green. The SRSI lines are above the 50-level. The red line is bent higher from below the green and currently at 57.31. The declining green line is currently at 66.01. The MACD lines are both declining slowly with the red below the green and starting to slightly increase the distance between the two lines. The DM lines are both in the noise, with the red line trying to move above the green. There is a \u201cbroken bicycle sprocket\u201d setting up with the candles flat while the indicators decline\u2026 it's an 8-Day chart so it will take awhile to correct\u2026 just be aware. The quarterly, monthly, and this 8-Day have rising 21MAs\u2026 until those lines begin to flatten the pressure is to the upside. The indications on this chart are for lower to sideways (with pressures pushing higher), and without extended upside permissions from the quarterly and monthly, at this point, but not a lot of downside permissions either (also a lot of rising potential support), in my opinion."

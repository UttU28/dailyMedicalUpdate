The candle opened at the close of the previous candle, it has moved lower, \u00a0and is currently a red candle (candle not closed).\u00a0By this point in a quarterly candle formation, it is unlikely to change significantly before the candle is closed, just the size of the body and wick but not likely the color.\u00a0The TBB is rising. The up auto-wave lines is attached to the currently forming candle. The 21MA is rising. The 13, 21, 34, and 55MAs are all rising and potential support areas. The BBB is also rising and potential support. The Christmas Cross lines have the red above the green and both rising. The SRSI lines are rising with the red line above the 50-level and the green below the 50-level. I have a downward channel drawn on the SRSI with the top line connecting points at 7/01/2018 and 10/01/2021. The red SRSI line is approaching that line but will not impact in this quarter. There is a potential bearish divergence forming on the SRSI and MACD (remember, this is a quarterly chart and it will take several quarters to form\u2026 so likely next year). The red MACD lines are rising with the red line decreasing the distance between the two lines. The green DM line is cocked below the 8-level. This chart is still wanting to go higher but starting to tire of the rise."

The conditions on this time-frame are potentially positioning for a decline in the coming MONTHS though that downward movement has barely started at this point. There are lessening permissions for upward movements. Sideways (slightly up and down) to lower are the permissions here to the smaller charts currently, in my opinion.

This chart does not seem to be tiring of the rise and currently not preparing for a decline in the near future. Though smaller charts can move up and down as needed, the permissions from this quarterly chart is to the upside or sideways (up and down as needed), in my opinion.

There are no specific permissions in place to go higher or lower at this point on this time-frame. Sideways (up or down as needed) and then eventually lower to test potential support areas\u2026 but this is a monthly chart and it will take months to reach the rising 13MA let alone the rising 21MA.

The indications for this chart are suggesting the move lower toward the summer lows has started. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see some lower movement toward the rising 13MA to test it as potential support. Again, this is an 8-Day chart and it may take several of these candles to get there.

The last candle opened and rose slightly\u00a0more closing as an even smaller white candle.\u00a0The\u00a0down\u00a0auto-wave has formed\u00a0and is\u00a0attached to the\u00a02nd\u00a0candle of today.\u00a0The 21MA is\u00a0slightly declining.\u00a0The 34,\u00a055, 89, 144, and 233MAs are all declining.\u00a0The TBB is declining.\u00a0The BBB is flat to slightly rising (squeeze).\u00a0The SRSI\u00a0lines are moving sideways above the 50-level with the red below the green and turning slightly higher.\u00a0The MACD\u00a0lines are almost on top of each other going sideways.\u00a0The DM lines are in the noise (sideways).\u00a0I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see sideways or slightly higher as we finish up Super-6.and start earning season movements. The permissions to rise from the bigger charts are\u00a0not clear\u00a0to this point, while the downside seems\u00a0not done. So sideways seems like here in the middle of the week.We trade what the evidence shows what it is doing now, without getting caught in \u201cwhat it has been doing\u201d or \u201cwhat we think will be coming next!\u201d We have to assess and put the puzzle together objectively each day, on each candle close, and not get caught up in what has been or what we hope will be.The puzzle pieces that we have to add right now are Super-6 and the beginning of earning season while being aware that we are almost \u00be the way through the Transitional Movement Zone.Of course this is just Chart Watch. We have to be aware of the YTEI, the MTM, the MZ, the time of the month, and the historical movements of the stock or market."
